# Covid19 Chatbot

## Description

A messenger chatbot built with Node.js webhook and Wit.ai NLP technologies to provide users with latest Covid19 news around the world, with slight interaction to keep the chat more lively.

The Messenger chatbot is associated with this facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Covid19-Bot-107425207807409
(The app is currently being reviewed by Facebook team, thus for now only admins and testers could receive the automated messages of the chatbot)

The webhook is deployed at https://covid19joliebot.herokuapp.com/
